# GifVision User Manual

Welcome to GifVision! This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to start creating amazing GIFs from your videos.

## 1. Introduction
> **System Requirement:** GifVision ships with FFmpegKit from `io.github.jamaismagic.ffmpeg:ffmpeg-kit-lts-16kb:6.0.1` and will not function with any other FFmpeg distribution. Do not sideload or attempt to swap native binaries.

GifVision is a powerful and creative tool that transforms your videos into unique animated GIFs. With a wide array of effects, blending modes, and a unique layering system, you can unleash your creativity and produce truly stunning visual art.

## 2. Getting Started: Your First GIF

Creating a GIF is a simple process. Heres a quick guide to get you started:

1.  **Upload a Video:** In **Layer 1**, click on "Browse Files" or drag and drop a video file into the upload area. You can also replace an existing clip at any time by using the **Change** action in the upload cardthis opens the same file picker so you can swap sources without leaving the workflow.
2.  **Select a Clip:** Use the video preview player to find the part of the video you want to turn into a GIF. Use the **Clip Duration** slider in the **Adjustments** panel to trim your video.
3.  **Generate:** Click the **Generate GIF** button in the **Preview (Layer 1 Source A)** card.

That's it! Your first GIF will be generated and will appear in the preview area.

## 3. The GifVision Interface

GifVision's interface is designed to be powerful yet intuitive. It is divided into several key areas:

### Layers and Streams

GifVision uses a unique system of **Layers** and **Streams** to give you maximum creative control.

*   **Layers:** Think of layers like transparent sheets on which you create your GIFs. You can work with up to two layers (Layer 1 and Layer 2). This allows you to create two different GIFs from two different (or the same) source videos and then blend them together.
*   **Streams:** Each Layer has two **Streams**, **A** and **B**. This means for each video you upload, you can create two different versions of a GIF with different effects. You can then blend these two streams together.

You can switch between Streams using the toggle buttons in the **Adjustments** panel.

### MAIN PAGES (lAYER 1 and LAYER 2  each page is the same as the other)

*   **Upload Card:** This is where you upload your source video for each layer. Each card provides a drag-and-drop zone as well as a **Browse Files** button so you can pick clips however you prefer. If you already have a clip loaded, the card shows its filename alongside a **Change** button; selecting **Change** lets you pick a replacement file immediately.
*   **Video Preview:** Once a video is uploaded, you can play it here and scrub through to find the perfect segment for your GIF.
*   **Adjustments Panel:** This is the heart of GifVision's creative power. Here you can tweak a wide variety of settings for the selected Layer and Stream.
*   **Preview Card:** This card shows the generated GIF for a specific stream (e.g., Layer 1, Stream A). From here you can regenerate, save, or share your GIF.
*   **Blend Preview Card:** This card is for blending the A and B streams of a single layer. You can choose a blend mode and opacity to combine them.

BLEND PAGE
*   **Master Blend:** This is the final step. Here you can blend the results of Layer 1 and Layer 2 together to create a final, multi-layered masterpiece.



ON ALL PAGES:
*FFmpeg Logs:** For advanced users or for troubleshooting, this section shows the output from the FFmpeg video processing engine.*   *

## 4. The Creative Toolkit: Effects and Adjustments

The **Adjustments** panel is where the magic happens. Here's a breakdown of the available effects:

### Quality & Size

*   **Resolution:** Controls the width of your GIF. A lower percentage will result in a smaller file size.
*   **Max Colors:** Sets the number of colors in the GIF's palette. Fewer colors mean a smaller file size but can result in color banding.
*   **Framerate:** The number of frames per second (FPS). Higher FPS results in smoother animation but a larger file size.

### Text Overlay

*   **Text:** Add text that will be displayed on your GIF.
*   **Font Size & Color:** Customize the appearance of your text overlay.

### Color & Tone

*   **Brightness, Contrast, Saturation:** Standard color correction tools to fine-tune the look of your GIF.
*   **Hue:** Shifts the colors of the entire image.
*   **Sepia Tone:** Adds a classic, brownish tint to your GIF.
*   **Color Balance:** Adjust the levels of Red, Green, and Blue in your GIF for precise color grading.

### Experimental & Artistic Filters

This is where you can get really creative!

*   **Chroma Warp:** A psychedelic effect that cycles through hues and sharpens the image.
*   **Color Cycle Speed:** Makes the colors in your GIF cycle over time.
*   **Motion Trails:** Creates a "ghosting" or "echo" effect.
*   **Sharpen:** Enhances the details in your GIF.
*   **Edge Detect:** Creates a stylized, cartoon-like outline effect.
*   **Negate Colors:** Inverts the colors of the GIF.
*   **Flip Horizontal/Vertical:** Flips the image on its axis.

## 5. Blending: Combining Your Creations

GifVision's blending capabilities allow you to combine your GIFs in creative ways.

### Layer Blending

1.  Generate a GIF for **Stream A** and **Stream B** of a layer.
2.  Go to the **Blend Preview** card for that layer.
3.  Select a **Blend Mode**. Each mode combines the pixels of the two GIFs in a different mathematical way, creating a wide range of visual effects.
4.  Adjust the **Opacity** to control the transparency of the top layer (Stream B).
5.  Click **Generate Blended GIF**.

### Master Blending

The **Master Blend** card appears as soon as at least one layer has footage uploaded, but the controls only become active after both Layer 1 and Layer 2 have finished rendering their individual blended GIFs. At that point you can:

1.  Open the **Blend Mode** dropdown to choose how the two layer outputs are composited together. The options mirror the layer-level blending choices so you can stay consistent or experiment with new combinations.
2.  Drag the **Opacity** slider (0.001.00) to balance how much of Layer 2 shows through over Layer 1. The numeric readout next to the label updates in real time so you can dial in precise values before generating the final mix.
3.  Press **Generate Master Blend** to send the request to the backend. While processing, the card locks to prevent duplicate submissions and the progress bar reports rendering status until the finished GIF preview appears.

## 6. Saving and Sharing

Once the master blended GIF is ready, click **Save** to download it locally. The adjacent **Share** button is shown as a placeholder for upcoming social and link sharing features, so expect it to remain inactive until that future work ships.

## 7. Troubleshooting

If you run into any issues, here are a few things to check:

*   **Library integrity:** Confirm the application is still using `io.github.jamaismagic.ffmpeg:ffmpeg-kit-lts-16kb:6.0.1`. The app is unsupported with any other FFmpeg builds.

*   **"GIF Generation Failed" error:**
    1.  **Check the FFmpeg Logs:** This is the most important step. The logs will almost always contain the specific error message from FFmpeg.
    2.  **Invalid Filter Parameters:** A common cause of errors is an invalid combination of filters or invalid parameters for a filter.
    3.  **Resource Issues:** Very large videos or very high-resolution settings may cause the server to run out of memory.

*   **Unexpected Visual Output:**
    *   If a filter doesn't seem to be working, first check the "FFmpeg Logs" to ensure it was included in the command.
    *   The order of filters matters. If you are an advanced user modifying the code, be aware that changing the filter order can dramatically change the output.
    *   Selecting a new source file automatically clears previews, blended GIFs, and master blend results for that layer. This reset is expected behavior so you can start over with clean settings; regenerate outputs after uploading the new clip.
